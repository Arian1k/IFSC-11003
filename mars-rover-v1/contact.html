   <p>NASA first started exploring Mars in 1964. Making their goals to try to study, explore, understand, and analyze this planet. 
        Since then, they have done many studies and sent out many spacecrafts to help us answer many questions including one main question, "Is there another planet habitable to humans'?"</p>
                
    <p>It all started with the Mariner 4 Mission, sending a spacecraft to just to fly by the planet, so that they could get an idea of what this planet looked like up close.
        Since then, we have developed our technology, so instead of just spacecrafts to just get a look. We started sending rovers to actually land on this planet to explore.</p>

    <p>Their exploration and curiosity has tremendously helped us understand what is beyond. Now use this page to explore your curiosity!
        Learn about what was put into each mission and what the outcomes were to those missions. Find out how these missions are shaping our future and our future explorers, which could be 'YOU'.</p>

        <h2>Spirit</h2>
      </header>
     <p>
        <ul>Spirit was launched on June 10th, 2003 to go explore Mars. The mission for Spirit was to see what was there besides water.
          Spirit was a very successful rover, it uncovered that Mars is much wetter than anticipated. It also captured a picture of bedrock that showed Mars's geological history.
          It also captured current time moments of dust devils(a whirlwind of dirt caused by wind).</ul>
        <ul>Unfortunately, Spirits' mission was discontinued on May 25th, 2011 due to the fact that Spirit got stuck in mud on Mars and eventually lost contact to Nasa.
          It had an incredible run of informing Nasa about Mars for a little over 6 years. According to Nasa, it lasted 25 times longer than what they anticipated it to last. 
          Fun fact as well, Spirit is the twin rover to 'Opportunity'.</ul>

        <h2>Curiosity</h2>
      </header>
     <p>
        <ul>Curiosity was launched on November 26th, 2011. It made its landing on Mars on August 6th, 2012. 
        Its' mission was to find out if Mars was able to support and maintain microbial life such as bacteria or fungi. Its' accomplishments on this mission were that it collected 42 powdered rock samples due to the drill that was placed on its arm.
        Along with the samples, it captured pictures of the holes that it drilled to obtain those rock samples. It also found an ancient streambed that once held water on mars.</ul>
        <ul>Curiosity and its' mission still continues til this day, it is still informing us more and more about Mars and whether Mars can maintain life. Fun fact for Curiosity, it weighs almost 2000 pounds, which is relatable to the size of a Mini Cooper.
          Because of its size, it makes it one of the largest rovers sent to Mars.</ul>

        <h2>Opportunity</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        <ul>Opportunity was launched on July 7th, 2003. It soon landed on Mars on January 24th, 2004. The mission was to find out about the climate and the water on Mars, just as Spirit's mission.
        It accomplished at finding out that Mars at one point in time was able to sustain microbial life. It also outlasted its life expectancy by 60 times, it continued its mission for 15 years.
        It was a record breaking rover, as well as a rover that was the start of many 'firsts', such as setting a record for escaping the steepest slope Nasa had encountered.</ul>
      <ul>The mission came to an end on February 13th, 2019. It was a very successful mission, it had traveled over 28 miles by the time it reached its final resting spot.
        Opportunity was equipped with Pancams and Navcams to help. The 'Pancam' is a panoramic camera to help us see what the rover is seeing. The 'Navcam' is a navigation camera used for the rover to guide where it needs to go.</ul>
